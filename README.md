# Smash-Hit-Assets-Renamer

IDK why but smash hit adds a .mp3 extension to all of its assets. 

So when you double click on them it will open up Windows Media Player instead of a text editor, which will of couse then say format not recognized because in fact they are not mp3 audio files at all. 

If you link mp3 files to a text editor. Then, oops, all mp3 songs on your device are going to be opened as a text file from now on. 

Also, you cannot edit these files using apk editor studio simply because the .mp3 extension confused apk editor studio! 

So, I wrote this simple tool to batch rename all files in the assets folder to make them editable again. 

Then, there's another option to put back the .mp3 extension to get ready for packing. 

You still need the .mp3 extension for the modifyed game to work. It's hard coded into smash hit and you can't change that. 

So please make sure you have all the .mp3 extension put back before you pack the apk.
